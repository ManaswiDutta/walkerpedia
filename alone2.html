We were young, posters on the wall
Praying we're the ones that the teacher wouldn't call
We would stare at each other
'Cause we were always in trouble
And all the cool kids did their own thing
I was on the outside always looking in
Yeah, I was there but I wasn't
They never really cared if I wasn't
We all need that someone who gets you like no one else
Right when you need it the most
We all need a soul to rely on, a shoulder to cry on
A friend through the highs and the lows
I'm not gonna make it a-la,
la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone
I'm not gonna make it a-la, 
la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone
Then I saw your face, your forgivin' eyes
Looking back at me from the other side
Like you understood me
And I'm never letting you go, oh
We all need that someone 
 who gets you like no one else
Right when you need it the most
We all need a soul to rely on,
 a shoulder to cry on
A friend through the highs and the lows
I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la,
 la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone
I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la,
 la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone
I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la,
 la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone
I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la,
 la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone
I'm not gonna make it alone
(La, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone)
I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la,
 la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone
'Cause you are that someone 
that gets me like no one else
Right when I need it the most
And I'll be the one you rely on,
 a shoulder to cry on
A friend through the highs and the lows
I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la,
la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone
I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la,
 la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone
I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la, la,
 la-la-la-la-la, 'lone
I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la, la,
 la-la-la-la-la, 'lone
I'm not gonna make it alone
