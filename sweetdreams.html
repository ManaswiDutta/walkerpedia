You're like the mist in the morning
You're a moment, body warming
I can't resist where you're going
Make me an ocean, overflowing
Sweet dreams of your love
Keeping me up, can't get enough
Sweet dreams of your touch
Do what you want, just keep it up
To the rhythm of the beat
Ba-ba-ba-da-bum
Ba-ba-ba-da-bum
Beat, ba-ba-ba-da-bum
Ba-ba-ba
To the rhythm of the beat
Ba-ba-ba-da-bum
Ba-ba-ba-da-bum
Beat, ba-ba-ba-da-bum
Ba-ba-ba-da-bum
Waves, as they're rolling
As they're growing, can't control 'em
Caught in a haze up on the ceiling
You got me feeling, I must be dreaming
Sweet dreams of your love
Keeping me up, can't get enough
Sweet dreams of your touch
Do what you want, just keep it up
To the rhythm of the beat
Ba-ba-ba-da-bum
Ba-ba-ba-da-bum
Beat, ba-ba-ba-da-bum
To the rhythm of the beat
Ba-ba-ba-da-bum
Ba-ba-ba-da-bum
Beat, ba-ba-ba-da-bum
Ba-ba-ba
To the rhythm of the beat
Ba-ba-ba-da-bum
Ba-ba-ba-da-bum
Beat, ba-ba-ba-da-bum
(Beat, beat, beat, to the beat)
Beat, ba-ba-ba-da-bum
Ba-ba-ba-da-bum
Beat, ba-ba-ba-da-bum
Ba-ba-ba
To the rhythm of the beat
Ba-ba-ba-da-bum
Ba-ba-ba-da-bum
Beat, ba-ba-ba-da-bum
Ba-ba-ba
To the rhythm of the-
